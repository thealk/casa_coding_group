## R Packages & Libraries
**Packages** are bundles of code written to do (typically) specific sets of functions

- Some packages are automatically downloaded and loaded into your workspace when you install R
- Others you have to explicitly download
- Many packages are hosted on CRAN - this is the official "home" of peer-approved packages
  - These can be installed using the function `install.packages()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

- Other packages are not hosted on CRAN - many of these are excellent, but some may be less reliable.
  - Many of these are hosted on GitHub.com 
  - These usually have to be installed using a function `install_github()` which is part of the `devtools` package.
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")
```


For example: To install the `emo` package from Hadley Wickham's Github page: 

- [https://github.com/hadley/emo]()

![](img/install_emo.png)

## Libraries
- Libraries in R refer to where the packages are stored. When you install a new package, it gets automatically saved to a particular location (you don't need to specify where). When you want to *use* the contents/functions of a package, you need to "load the library" using the `library()` function.

```{r message=TRUE}
# load the tidyverse package
# expect a bunch of output messages (this is normal)
library(tidyverse) 
```

- If you ask R to load a package you don't have installed, or make a typo in the package name, R will yell at you (give you an *error*):

```{r message=TRUE, warning=TRUE, error=TRUE}
# Typo! what happens? R yells at you.
library(tidverse)
```


## What can you do with R code?
### Use it like a calculator
```{r echo=TRUE}
3 + 2
10^4
4*100
```

## What can you do with R code?
### Print information to the console

```{r echo=TRUE}
print("Hello!")
print(3*5)
```

## What can you do with R code?
### Create new objects

*Read the following as "x is equal to 5"*

```{r echo = TRUE}
x <- 5
```

*And we can now type x in the console to see its value*
```{r echo=TRUE}
x
```

x is now a **variable** that is set to the value of the number 5.

## Variables
**Variable**: a symbol that stores/represents some other *value* or set of values.

Think of variables as containers.

<img src="../img/find_x.jpg" width=500/>
</center>


## Variable assignment
Variables get **assigned** their value in R with a left arrow `<-`

**Numeric variables** represent numbers
```{r}
x <- 5
```

This means the value of the variable we have named `x` is equal to 5.

**String variables** represent "strings" of text. Text has to be enclosed in quotes `""`

```{r}
my_var <- "hello"
```

This means the value of the variable `my_var` is equal to the text "hello".

## Variable assignment
Variables don't just hold numbers and text - they can hold sets of numbers/text, lists of various kinds of information, and whole data sets!

When you create a new variable in R, you will see it in your Environment pane.

<img src = "../img/environment.png" width=300/>


## What do I name my variables?

## Best practices in naming your variables {-}
In R, it's pretty flexible. Not as flexible in other languages (*\*cough\* Praat \*cough\**)

*Some suggestions*

Try your best to...

- Be descriptive
- Be consistent in your content
- Be consistent in your case (camel/snake/etc)

*i_like_snake_case* but some people *likeCamelCase* and others may *like-kabob-case*,

## Variable names: Choose your case

</font>
</center>

## Variable names: Not okay

**General rules:**

|    Not allowed     |                                         Why                                          |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        1abc        |                                 Starts with a number                                 |
|  intelligibility%  |                   Contains a special character like !@#$%^&*, etc.                   |
|      .1my_var      |                    Starts with a period followed by a number (.1                     |
|      _my_var       |                            Starts with an underscore (\_)                            |
| special characters | Some words have special meaning to R and you shouldn't overwrite them (e.g., "mean") |

## Variable names: Better

|                  Allowed |                      Good because |               Bad because |
| -----------------------: | --------------------------------: | ------------------------: |
|                        x |                  short, lowercase |            Not meaningful |
|   intelligibility_scores |      meaningful, easy to remember | Takes a long time to type |
|                 int_mean |                 meaningful, short |      `r emo::ji("shrug")` |
| int_mean_pd, int_mean_hc | meaningful, shortish, descriptive |                A bit long |


## Beware of typos!
```{r error=TRUE}
my_var <- 5

My_var
myVar
my_var
```


## But will I break it?

## Try it!

### Numeric variables
In your console, do the following:

- Create a variable x and assign it a value of some number
- Create a variable of y and assign it a value of some other number
- Create some other variable (name it whatever you like!) and assign it a value of yet another number

### String variables
In your console, do the following:

- Create a variable `a` and assign it a value of some text (don't forget to enclose the text in quotes!)
- Create a variable `b` and assign it a value of some other text
- Create a variable with another name and assign it yet another text value


## Types of data
1. Numeric
  - Integers (whole numbers)
2. Strings: collection of characters
  - e.g., "abc", "the rainbow is a division of white light"
  - numbers and other non-letter characters can also be treated as strings
3. Factors: categorical variables. Make up a finite set
  - e.g., "Blue" "Green" "Red"
4. Logicals: special kind of factor that only has two values
  - TRUE vs FALSE, 0 vs 1
  
## Types of data structures
1. **Data frames**: collections of vectors
2. **Vectors**: collection of similar elements (numbers, characters, factors, etc..)
3. Matrices
4. Lists
5. Arrays

## Comments
- In R code, any line of code preceded by a hashmark (#) is not *evaluated* (i.e., it's ignored)
- You can write notes to your future self this way

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Set x equal to 0
x <- 0
# Now add 1 to the value of x
y <- x+1
```




## Functions
**Functions**: A certain named format of code that outlines a procedure. Often this allows several lines of code to be executed with a single line of code (by using the name of the function) 

- In other words, functions are **actions**. 
- Most functions take **arguments**
  - What do you want to act on?

## Calling functions

### function_name(argument1, argument2, ...)

- In R Studio, if you start typing the name of a function and hit tab, you will get a pop up with possible options. 
- Within the () of the function, pressing tab will help you add the arguments.

## Looking at data: A spreadsheet perspective

```{r echo=FALSE}
my_data <- read.csv("../presentations/2_materials/simulated_vot_data.csv")
```

Most of us are used to looking at data in the form of a spreadsheet.

- Named columns with many rows
- Each row usually represents one observation

*See simulated_vot_data.csv*

## Looking at data: A spreadsheet perspective

### My usual workflow: 

- Collect data in spreadsheet
- Load spreadsheet data into R
- Do all other data manipulation and analyses in R

## Looking at data
### A spreadsheet perspective

In R, data often are stored in `data_frames`. 

Columns stored in variables named with the column header name

To access individual columns, use the `$` operator

```{r eval = FALSE}
my_data$Participant
```

## Looking at data
### Take a peak

To peak at the first 6 rows of the data, use the `head()` function

```{r}
head(my_data)
```


## Looking at data
### Subsetting

We can also look at subsets of data

```{r}
subset(my_data, Condition=="Fast")
```


## Looking at data
### Using the pipe `%>%` to combine functions

```{r eval=FALSE}
my_data %>%
  first_do(args) %>%
  then_do(args)
```


```{r}
my_data %>%
  subset(Condition=="Fast") %>%
  head()
```


## Tidyverse

>"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."
[www.tidyverse.org]()

- Changed the game of R coding
- Much more intuitive syntax (IMHO); more "english-like"
- BUT not everyone likes it. Sometimes makes things easier, sometimes makes things more complicated.
- We'll be using both
- Core packages of the tidyverse: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, stringr...


## Tidy data & the Tidyverse
- See https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_auckland/blob/master/2017-12_tidyverse-6-auckland.pdf

- "the pipe is syntactic sugar"

## Disclaimer
- We will cover both base R and the Tidyverse

## Getting started: R Projects

## Application

## Rmarkdown
[![Allison Horst](img/horst_rmarkdown_wizards.png)](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)
[RStudio's "What is R Markdown" Video](https://vimeo.com/178485416)

The goal of today's workshop is to establish a workflow for using the [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) package to "knit" together R code and text to create summary documents.

It might seem kind of odd to launch into a workflow that ties together R code *and other stuff* before we've actually had a chance to learn any R code, but here's the rationale:

1. `r emo::ji("hammer_and_wrench")` **Foundational skill:** R Markdown document creations can serve as a way to document the rest of our skills. At each workshop, we'll create another R Markdown document (extension .`Rmd`) to log the skills we worked on and any notes you'd like to keep for yourself. In this way, this skill is *foundational*.
2. `r emo::ji("raised_hands")` **Instant gratification!** R Markdown documents can be rendered without much working knowledge of R at all. It's a lovely thing when you can get something up and running RIGHT AWAY

## Markdown {-}
**Markdown** refers to a set of conventions for editing plain text. With markdown syntax, you write as you normally would in a text editor or word processor, but you signal text formatting with certain characters. Markdown (which is distinguished from *markUP* language) is designed to be **easily readable, easy to write, and easy to learn**.

```
*italic*
**bold**
**italic and bold!***

# First level header
## Second level header
## Third level header

1. the first item on a numbered list
2. the second item on a numbered list

- the first item on a bulleted list
- the second item on a bulleted list
  - item 2a
  
Tables look like this: 

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
```

## Code chunks {-}


## More advanced
- inline R code
- 

## Getting unstuck
- Google your errors!
- Google "how to use XX package in r"
- Search Twitter (#rstats)
