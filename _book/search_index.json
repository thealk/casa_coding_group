["index.html", "CASA Lab Coding for Speech Group Welcome", " CASA Lab Coding for Speech Group PI: Thea Knowles Welcome The purpose of this group is for members and friends of the CASA Lab to learn basic coding skills that are helpful for speech analysis. The languages/environments we will learn will usually be R and Praat, though we may extend to include other languages over time. Many of the skills we will work on will be directly applicable to projects in the CASA Lab, but the hope is that you will gain skills that you will find personally valuable as well for your own work. We will meet approximately twice a month. Meeting times TBD following an introductory meet and greet with interested members. Skills you may expect to gain: üìù Report generation: How to communicate your findings by integrating your writing with your analysis code (e.g., using R Markdown) üìä Data visualization: Creating informative and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations for communicating your results (e.g., using ggplot) üìÇ File organization &amp; manipulation: How to move, rename, or iterate over files on your computer. üó£ Acoustic analysis: How to write scripts in Praat for doing acoustic analysis on speech audio files.
