# Tentative Plan {#intro}


The schedule will depend on the goals of the group. At the moment (as of late January 2020), the tentative plan is the following:

- Biweekly meet ups in the CASA Lab (104 Cary Hall, UB South Campus).
- Each meet up will involve a brief tutorial to the skill we'll be working on.

Schedule of meet ups will appear below following the first meet up.
